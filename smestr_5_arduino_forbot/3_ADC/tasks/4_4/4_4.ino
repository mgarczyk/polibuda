/*

Try writing a simple game. 
After starting the program, turn the potentiometer to a random place and press a button. 
Then the Arduino should display a message on the PC:

Enter a number:

If the number sent to the Arduino agrees with the ADC reading by +/- 50, the player wins. 
Otherwise, the yellow LED turns on and the player has 2 more tries. When the wrong number is entered each time, 
a red LED turns on on the contact board. On the other hand, in case of a win, a green one is turned on.
