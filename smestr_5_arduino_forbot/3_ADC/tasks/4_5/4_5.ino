Use two photoresistors as separate voltage dividers. 
Place them on the extreme sides of the contact plate. 
Ideally, you should tilt them even minimally outward. 
Display the values of both sensors in the terminal. 
What happens when you wave your hand in front of the board (making a shadow) or shine a flashlight at it?
By analyzing the difference between the measurements from the two sensors, 
are you able to write a program that determines which side of the plate the stronger light source is on? 
Try to indicate the direction on 5 LEDs (more to the left, center, more to the right, etc.)!
