The task of the program will be to read the voltage on pin A0 and convert it accordingly. \
As it is written in the documentation 1Â°C is 10 mV. Therefore, first the ADC value must be converted to voltage.
As a reminder, we do this by multiplying the reading times 5, and then divide this result by 1024 (the operating range of the ADC is 0...1023).
1024 => 5V
1 => x
1024x = 1*5
x = (1*5V)/1024 = ~0,0049V
To get degrees Celcius at the end we multiply the resulting value times 100 (ADC read is in volts, 10mV is 1 degree, then 100 times 10mv is equal to 1V)).
