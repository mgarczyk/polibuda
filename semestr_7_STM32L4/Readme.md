# Forbot Description
STM32 microcontrollers have been popular for years, both among discerning hobbyists and professionals. It is time for more people to join this group. The STM32L4 course is a series of comprehensive tutorials that will help anyone learn about these powerful and energy-efficient microcontrollers in practice.

# Content
STM32 course content 
The course consists of 17 comprehensive articles, and each of them is a powerful dose of knowledge that could easily be divided into 2-3 separate texts:
  <ul>
      <li>1 - hardware platform and environment</li>
      <li>2 - input/output, or GPIO</li>
      <li>3 - communication via UART, debugger</li>
      <li>4 - timing the chip, RTC, watchdog, quiz</li>
      <li>5 - power saving (5 years on battery?).</li>
      <li>6 - hardware interrupts, error handling </li>
      <li>7 - hardware counters (PWM, encoder)</li>
      <li>8 - analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)</li>
      <li>9 - port expander (SPI), quiz</li>
      <li>10 - color TFT display (SPI).</li>
      <li>11 - external EEPROM (I2C).</li>
      <li>12 - pressure sensor, altitude measurement (I2C)</li>
      <li>13 - distance sensor, 7-seg. display.</li>
      <li>14 - WS2812B RGB LEDs (counters), quiz.</li>
      <li>15 - IR remote control, NEC (counters)</li>
